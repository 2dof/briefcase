The main scope of my working/experinece area includes process modeling in the field of advanced numerical algorithms including:
* Miedical Alghoritmis: ECG / EEG signal processing  ( from embedded to machine learning solutions), Image processing like:
  * ECG algorithms analysis ( ISO EN 60601-2-47,-2-27, -2-25 + ISO 14971) 
  * EEG algorithms analysis ( evenst/feature extraction)
  * Image processing (microscopic image procesing, objectecs/feature extraction) 
* Control Alghoritmis and process simulation ( form basic PID to fuzzy/advanced)
* Image/data processing for feture extraction/anomaly, for example:
  * material damage detection
  * object feature extraction, detection and tracking
