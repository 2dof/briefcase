The main scope of my working/experinece area includes process modeling in the field of advanced numerical algorithms including:
* Miedical Alghoritmis: ECG / EEG signal processing  ( from embedded to machine learning solutions) 
* Control Alghoritmis and process simulation ( form basic PID to fuzzy/advanced)
* Image/data processing for feture extraction/anomaly
